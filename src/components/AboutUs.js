                <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Golgotha Ministries is a beacon of faith and hope in the heart of Armoor, founded 26 years ago by the dedicated and passionate Pastor B.N. Rathnam. Our mission is simple yet profound: to share the gospel and win souls for Christ.
                </p>
                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe in spreading the message of love, redemption, and salvation to all, guided by the teachings of Jesus Christ. Our vision is to create a community of believers who are not only spiritually enriched but also actively engaged in making a positive impact on our world. Alongside him, we are privileged to have his son, Brother Samuel Mories, who is actively contributing as an associate in the ministry.
                </p>
                <p>
