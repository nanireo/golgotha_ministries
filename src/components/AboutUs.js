                        Golgotha Ministries is a beacon of faith and hope in the heart of Armoor, founded 26 years ago by the dedicated and passionate Pastor B.N. Rathnam. Our mission is simple yet profound: to share the gospel and win souls for Christ.

                        We believe in spreading the message of love, redemption, and salvation to all, guided by the teachings of Jesus Christ. Our vision is to create a community of believers who are not only spiritually enriched but also actively engaged in making a positive impact on our world. Alongside him, we are privileged to have his son, Brother Samuel Mories, who is actively contributing as an associate in the ministry.
